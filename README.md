# Particle Processing
This program is a school project for my CS101 class. The program simulates the processing of particles. It was designed with OOP principles in mind and consists of particle generator, collector, extractor, and refiner classes to model particle processing. Enumerations, abstract classes, and interfaces are also used in the program.
